    "Statistical analysis is important if you want to know that the estimate you obtained from your data (e.g. mean, difference in proportions, confidence interval, etc.) is close to that of the target population of interest. For example, if you were to conduct a clinical trial of a new locally manufactured COVID-19 vaccine in your country and if you were to prove that it is better than imported vaccines, then you need some statistical analysis to support your claim. If you are living a fantasy world, where you are almighty, all-powerful, and ultra-rich so that when you conduct this study, everyone in your country participated in the trial. That would be the perfect scenario. You can pinch yourself now and welcome back to reality. So, you pushed through with your clinical trial and enrolled 150 subjects, who were randomly assigned in each group and followed the protocol to the dot. Results showed that the efficacy of your local vaccine is higher (95% vs 50%) when compared to the imported vaccine. Given the results and samples size, can you claim that your local vaccine is better in protecting your fellow citizens compared to the imported vaccine? Thus, to answer this question, you need to do statistical inference."
